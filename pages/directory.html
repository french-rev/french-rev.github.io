				<p id="title">THE FORMATION OF THE DIRECTORY</p>
				<p id="pap">After the fall of Maximilien Robespierre’s National Convention as a result of dissent from the terror, the once purely radical government was once again altered into the directory, a form of government consisting of an executive and bicameral legislative branch. Its goal, similar to the other steps of the revolution, was to bring stability to the fractured nation with decreasing borders and a floundering economy. This was France’s third attempt at a more enlightened government without a single monarch that had absolute power over the people. This was also the Moderates and Conservatives attempts at bringing france stability; the radicals had already failed with the Terror.

				<p id="title">PROBLEMS</p>
				<div id="pap-right-wrapper">
					<p id="pap">The problem with "The Directory" was it was implemented too late. By the time moderates and conservatives were able to jump into the political sphere of France after the end of the Terror, France was in critical shape. The problem with a bicameral legislative branch is, by design, gridlock; two groups would always have to a compromise in order for policies to be passed. This reduced the speed of implementation of progressive policies that could bring France back to stability. This led to dissent within the population because progress was too slow. At the stage of dissent and critical economic failure, a leader could promise great change and possibly be supported by the public. It was Napoleon who did this.
